# 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science

| Category | Difficulty |
| :------: | :--------: |
|   HW     |     7      |
|  Exams   |     8      |
| Quizzes  |     4      |
| Term Project | Varies depending on what you choose |

Not exactly a "required" class for CS and ECE, but still a very good class to take for people with no or 
limited Computer Science experience. It offers a good overview of what computer science really is, and the
class uses Python. 

The course is graded conventionally, and the current percentage is as follows:
| Category | Percentage |
| :------: | :--------: |
| Quizzes | 10% |
| Homeworks | 30% |
| Midterms | 20% |
| Final | 20% |
| Term Project | 20% |

## Prerequisites

There is no prerequisite to this class. If you are really unsure about the difficulty of 15-112, you can start with 15-110.

## Homeworks

All homeworks are programming homeworks, covering topics taught in the week it is assigned. All homeworks are solo, with a few exceptions.
Programming homeworks can take a long time if you are unfamiliar with the concepts, so it is a good idea to go to lectures and
try your best to get a basic understanding there. Submission uses Autolab, and each homework gives you a number of attempts
(the number varies per assignment). Write enough test cases to make sure your code is working as intended, or you may lose points.

## Quizzes

Quizzes are offered every week, so it is important to go to lecture. They cover concepts taught in the previous week, and they are good examples
of what exam questions may look like. There are 8 quizzes per semester, and 2 lowest are half-weighted, so do not worry if you mess up one or two quiz.
They are meant as warnings that you may not understand that concept well and you should practice them. 

## Exams

The exams are not easy, especially since this class is likely one of your first "real" college classes. The first exam in particular can screw
people over hard, since they may not study hard for them. Actually study for the exams, since it is a big time crunch, and use both quizzes
and practice problems available on the 112 website, and try to do them as fast as possible without loss in accuracy. However, midterms are only 10%
of your grade, and the lower one is half-weighted, so if you bombed one midterm, treat it as a strong warning.

In short, grinding is the answer to doing well on exams.

## Term Project

This assignment will take the last 3ish weeks of class, and you will be expected to complete a project using Python and the 112-provided packages. The expectation is 300-500 lines.
There are past examples on the 112 website. Should be a few YouTube videos.
You will get a TA mentor who will guide you through the process and also grade you at checkpoints. The checkpoint grades go inside the Quiz category, while the final project score consists of the 20% of your final grade.
The TA mentor will help you choose a project, give you high-level advice, and decide on a Minimum Viable Product. Getting to the MVP by TP2 will give you at least a 80% on the final project.
Don't choose something that is too difficult to do. Look through the 112 website to see what you have been taught and come up with something based on that. Using advanced data structures will probably result to bugs that you do not know how to fix!
Do not miss the TA meetings! Remember that they are also students, and they are probably studying for finals during the TP period. You will lose a lot of points, and will probably upset the TAs a little.
You are allowed to use external packages, but you absolutely do not need to use them to get a high score. Especially if you are new to programming, it is best to avoid anything that is outside the scope of 112.
TAs will probably discourage you from using those packages, unless you can show them you know what you are doing. But, getting a high score does not require using packages!


## How to do well

- If you are not understanding a concept, the 112 lecture notes are extremely well written and reading them carefully should give you a good understanding of the concept. You can then use homework and other practice questions in the lecture notes to make sure you have a solid understanding.
- This is not like a high school class! This will be your introduction to what hard college classes are like. 
- Start early on the programming homeworks, so you have time to go to OH for questions.
- Some people call this one of the harder classes at CMU, but that may be due to them taking it freshman fall, and not knowing what "real" college classes are like. You need to get used to it if you are pursuing either CS or ECE. That is to say, it is not as difficult as some people say it is, but it is definitely not easy, and you should be prepared to spend time on the class.
- Professor OH can also be helpful if you have some conceptual questions.
- Make sure to follow the style guidelines. They do check.
